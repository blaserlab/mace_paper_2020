# mace_paper_2020
Data from 3 patients for Tom's paper, in revision March 2020.

Plots and stats have been generated per our in person discussion on March 16 2020.  This includes 100 specific markers per cluster and descriptive stats for cell numbers per cluster and per patient.

In addition, I have regenerated all of the plots from early February using version-tracked code available in github.

All plots are provided at approximately the right scale to be useful for your figures using 11 point as the base font size.  This can be modified if is not legible for you.
